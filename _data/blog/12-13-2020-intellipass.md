## **Problem**

Covid-19 has mandated new health guidelines to keep employees and customers safe. Everyone must adhere to PPE standards inline with OSHA's standards for infectious diseases. Businesses are struggling to keep up with these new standards and are unable to safely open their business. They shouldn't have to rely on human interaction and intervention to enforce these guidelines, that puts more people at risk.

## **Competitive Landscape**

First I conducted an analysis of other temperature screening systems (Richtech, Popshap, Spintouch, Real Time Networks) and identified their distinguishing features as well as what made each brand unique.

All companies offer the baseline features of temperature scanning and facial scanning with mask detection. Richtech and Real Time Networks also offer QR code-based health questionnaires and an additional visitor badge printing capability, however, it is unclear how these 2 features can be setup or if you have control over customization. There is also no employee ID card access feature. Emphasis

## **Opportunity**

In order to distinguish itself, a new entrant in this market should work to offer a reliable customizable solution that can scale beyond pandemic times. None of the competitors offer software to go along with the hardware. A software solution allows the business's security team to monitor from anywhere and is scalable to an unlimited amount of locations and kiosks. To achieve this Intellipass will offer encrypted cloud-based software to go along with the hardware. It will also offer an NFC card scanner which can be used as a two-factor authentication for entry, serve as a backup where facial recognition is not setup, or simply be connected to access control systems when mask detection is not needed. All facial recognition data will be saved on the local device for security and the device will feature an IP65 water and dust resistant standard for longevity.

## **Target Audience**

Businesses who want to protect their customers and hardworking employees and promote a safe working environment. These businesses would be at high-risk due to the number of people coming in and out of the building.

Categories include banks, gyms, daycare centers, airports, private schools, stadiums, office buildings, clinics and hospitals, and factories.

## **Distribution**

We will leverage the reseller's network to get an introduction to the businesses. They will aggressively push the product in the market, demo, and finalize the sale. Once the sale is finalized the installation, setup, software authentication, and support will be managed by our in-house team.

Due to the technical and high-priced nature of the product, this will not be an e-comm solution where the customers can purchase the device on the website. We want to maintain customer satisfaction and want to ensure they understand all the features, security standards, and have no problem with setting up the device(s) at their site.

## **Pricing Strategy**

We will undercut the prices on the market by 10-40% to reduce the burden on businesses of upfront capital investment. Our software solution will be priced at $75/month which will allow for unlimited user access and 30,000 employees to be uploaded and managed from the system.

## **Design Principles**

#### **Overview**

I developed a set of design principles to use as guidelines for determining the look and feel of the landing page. The focus was on minimalism so the UX feels intuitive and natural. The UI is in service of functionality, always clear and helpful, never intrusive. It also needs to convey reliability. Even though engagement is simple, you can count on the solution to always work and promote safety for customers and employees.

Intuitive: UX feels natural and copy is clear and succinct 

Simple: UI is clean, airy, and minimal



#### Typography

Barlow Condensed

Bahnschrift



#### Color Scheme

The primary color was chosen to convey wisdom and is often associated with feelings of happiness and calm. Want the customers to feel that they are without a doubt making the right choice by making an investment for their customers and employee's well being and will bring peace as they open up their businesses.

Primary: #992e72

Secondary: #001e42Unordered



## **Landing page**

The landing page was designed to serve as a central point for leads from all marketing channels, including, tv and google ads, email marketing, and word of mouth advertising. It should be a way for potential customers to get an understanding of how Intellipass can help open their business safely. I included automation with Mailchimp and Calendly for customers to quickly sign up for a session with one of the sales reps to ask questions and demo the software (dashboards, settings, device options, etc).
